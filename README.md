# Number Guessing Game

Welcome to the **Number Guessing Game**! This is a simple Python game where the player attempts to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100.

## How to Play

1. The game will generate a secret number between 1 and 100.
2. You will be prompted to guess the number.
3. After each guess, the game will tell you whether your guess was too low, too high, or correct.
4. You have a limited number of attempts to guess the number (default is 10).
5. If you guess the number correctly within the allowed attempts, you win!
6. After the game ends, you can choose to play again or exit.

## Features

- **Input Validation**: Ensures that the player enters a valid number between 1 and 100.
- **Feedback**: Provides hints if the guess is too low or too high.
- **Maximum Attempts**: Limits the number of guesses to 10, making the game more challenging.
